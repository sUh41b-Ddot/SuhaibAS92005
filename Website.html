<div class = "fle">The ocean covers more than 70% of our planet and plays a huge role in keeping the climate balanced by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide. It’s home to an incredible variety of life—from tiny plankton to huge whales—many of which we still don’t fully understand. The ocean also provides food, jobs, and fun for billions of people around the world. But it’s facing big problems like pollution, overfishing, and climate change, which threaten marine life and ecosystems. Protecting the ocean is really important if we want to keep our planet healthy for future generations.
New Zealand’s ocean is full of life and always changing. It’s important for both
    nature and people, but it’s facing big problems like pollution and over fishing.
    If we could watch the ocean closely all the time, we’d understand it better and be
    able to protect it for the future.</div>
